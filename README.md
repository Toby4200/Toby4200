##  🙋‍♂️ Hello, I’m Anatolii!

I’m a **seasoned Frontend Developer** with over 5 years of professional experience building scalable and user-focused web applications using **React.js** and **Vue.js**.  
My expertise lies in crafting intuitive user interfaces, optimizing application performance, and collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams.

I have a proven track record of:
* Developing complex frontend architectures for enterprise and startup projects.
* Mentoring junior developers to help teams grow and succeed.
* Using modern tools like Redux Toolkit, React Query, and CSS-in-JS to build maintainable and robust applications.  

I’ve worked in big companies like **Yandex**, **Alfa Bank**, and **X5 FoodTech**, as well as dynamic startups such as **Restik** and **AgroHub**, contributing to industries ranging from **FinTech**, **FoodTech**, **Marketplaces** to AI-powered solutions.

I’m passionate about clean code, user-centric design, and staying updated with the latest frontend technologies.
